## Description
We were tasked with creating a website selling rain jackets. I chose to create my own brand and went for the brand name Intrepid. 
I chose this name as the brand was supposed to be for people that liked pushing boundries and adventuring.
I was originally given this task as the first ever project using only HTML and CSS. We later revamped the project using javascript and added
some functionality.
